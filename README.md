# 🚀 sentiric-traffic-cache

**The Invisible Network Assistant.** An intelligent, universal caching layer designed to accelerate development workflows and simplify network management for everyone, from individual developers to entire offices.

> This project is currently in the initial construction phase. For the complete vision and roadmap, please see [docs/PROJECT_GENESIS.md](docs/PROJECT_GENESIS.md).

## ✨ Core Philosophy

`sentiric-traffic-cache` is built to eliminate the "inefficiency tax" of modern software development—specifically, the time and bandwidth wasted on re-downloading dependencies (`docker pull`, `apt-get`, etc.) for the sake of creating clean, reproducible environments.

This power is then extended to the entire network, providing a seamless, zero-configuration speed boost for any connected device.

## 🏛️ Architecture

The project is built on a modular, testable, and maintainable architecture using a Cargo Workspace. For a detailed overview, please refer to the [Project Genesis document](docs/PROJECT_GENESIS.md).

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

> Instructions for building and running the project will be available here soon.
