    //! The Service Crate
    //!
    //! This crate implements the actual services that power the application,
    //! such as the proxy server, DNS server, and management API. It uses the
    //! building blocks from `sentiric-core` and integrates them with frameworks
    //! like Hyper, Warp, and Trust-DNS.

        println!("Service layer starting...");
        // In the future, this will start all services (proxy, dns, management).
        println!("Hello from the service layer!");
